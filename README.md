The final draft of my rich web dev assignment


I have performed an update via the github gui from my laptop however I'm not sure if it worked correctly and so I have also uploaded the project via webcourses . The webcourses submission contains the following readme :


To deploy the app simply go to the folder 
  											right click ,
												Select git bash
												type "meteor" to deploy on localhost
												or "meteor deploy RWDBooks" to deploy normally

Once this is done the app will become visible
to login in as Admin username "admin" password "password1" 

To add a category click the "+" symbol ,
To rate a book click the button beside the "X" located in the list section

References:
the layout for the app was inspired by the site http://www.thonik.nl/
For the code sections I used the Book "getting started with meteor and javascript framework" 
as well as examing code found on github , madewith.meteor.com and zeewee.com and dreamincode.net

I have added links to both facebook and twitter accounts simply to show the functionality so the pages the links
bring you to are very light on content.
